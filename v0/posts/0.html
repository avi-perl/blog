    <h1>About this blog</h1>
    <p>
        In a way, writing with a typewriter is extremely simple and very honest. Simple because there is just a writer,
        a machine, and a piece of paper. Honest, because you cannot go back, you cannot hide the past. (Sure, you can
        block your mistake with whiteout, but we know you did.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Modern web development is the opposite of simple, behind a simple landing page is typically hundreds of lines of
        JS, CSS, and HTML that your browser consumes, not to mention an ungodly amount of code in the build system that
        generated the JS, CSS, and HTML you are consuming.
    </p>
    <p>
        What if, as a platform to share typed pages (and any other blog worthy content), I tried to embrace this
        simplicity and honesty while building a website? Here's my idea, and the rules for it:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The site is static.</li>
        <li>Absolute minimum amounts of HTML & CSS.</li>
        <li>The website functions without JS.</li>
        <li>JS is never used unless it is central to a post.</li>
        <li>The site is versioned, past design is never modified.</li>
        <li>A minimal build system is allowed to generate the site, as long as the resulting output follows the above rules.</li>
    </ul>
