<h2>MANUFACTURING CASH ON A TYPEWRITER</h2>

<p>My daughter  recently  asked  me  to
draw her some cash for  a  game  she
was playing. After helping her  have
her fun, I got to thinking "my turn!
Can  money  be  typed   out   on   a
    typewriter?"</p>

<p>A  quick  Google  search  led  me to
this bill on asciiart.eu:</p>

<p>I typed one out  on  a  3x5in  index
card but thought the  result  was  a
bit squished. Copying the art  to  a
file, I modified the design to be  a
bit taller, simplified  the  design,
and changed  the  â€œ{G}'  to  be  her
Initials.</p>

<p>Since my typewriter  does  not  have
all the characters I need, some were
written by hand; these are indicated
in gray. Here  is  my  final  design
from my working document (the bottom
line is  an  underline  to  simulate
writing  '_'  over  the   proceeding
line.) </p>

<p>Here are  the  actual  characters  I
used so you can copy them. The  last
line  is  typed  on   top   of   the
proceeding  line  by   sliding   the
carriage return without moving to  a
new line.</p>

<p>I was able to fit  10  bills  on  an
8.5x11 sheet of paper.  I  found  it
simpler to make each bill at a  time
- first on the list column, then  on
the right after resetting my  margin
- than try to make 2 at once  across
2 columns. It took me just  over  an
hour to make a full sheet, time well
spent if you ask me :)</p>

<p>In all, I made  about  20  bills  on
index  cards,  colored  paper  (best
result) and on paper my daughter had
painted. After cutting, I  put  them
through  a  lamination  machine  for
longevity.</p>

<p>My kids enjoy them, and they quickly
got used not just as money,  but  as
airline tickets for flights on board
Air-Oversized-Amazon-Box as well.</p>
